## Partial Sandbox Configuration
### Custom Settings
Use custom settings to create and manage custom data at the organization, profile, and user levels. 
* Custom settings data is stored in the application cache. This means you can access it efficiently, without the cost of repeated queries. 
* Custom settings data can be used by formula fields, Visualforce, Apex, and the Web Services API.
